# The Dolmen Website

This is a website to advertise The Dolmen, a band based in the South West of England.
It will appeal to new and current fans who would like to keep up to date or get familiar with The Dolmen.

# UX

This website will start with 3 webpages, Home page, Events page and a Gallery page including pictures.

## User Stories

### Home
* If a user would wish to access any social media pages they would click on the icons, 
for example if they wanted to go to their facebook page, 
they would click on the Facebook icon at the footer of the page.
This will apply to all pages in the website.

* If a user wishes to go to another page they would do so by accessing the menu, for example they would navigate to 
the top right and click on "Events" to access the Events page if they wish to see what is next up for the band and where it will be.


The Events page will have a table showing all their events in the calender year.



The gallery page will consist of various pictures of the band performing at gigs and some promotion imagery.

# Features

The website currently has some basic features

Firstly it has a bootstrap driven menu which works on both desktop and mobile. This will help the user to navigate to each page. If they should want to come home, they can either click on "Home" or "The Dolmen".

The events page has a basic but ledgible bootstrap table which shows the user what the upcoming events are for the dolmen, where they are and when they are going to take place.

The Gallery page has different pictures of the band at different shows to give the user a sense of who the band are and the style of music they play as well as a scope of the type of festivals they may attend.

# Testing 

I have tested the following features to make sure that they work efficiently:

Menu - This displays clearly in either desktop or mobile form when I click on the button. I am able to navigate through each site by its designated link and I am always able to go back to the home screen

Events Table - The table in events displays clearly and reduces well in mobile form for ease of access.

Gallery - The photos in the gallery respond well to different screen resolutions and always display clearly in the right columns.
